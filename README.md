# Hi
I've been meaning to follow this book for a bit now, so here I am.

The book in question is the well known [Ray Tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book by  **Peter Shirley**, **Trevor David Black** and **Steve Hollasch**.

The code isn't an exact copy of theirs, I'll code in my style with some of my ideas and understandings, but the ideas are basically the same.
