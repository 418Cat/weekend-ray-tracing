# Hi
I've been meaning to follow this book for a bit now, so here I am.

The book in question is the well known [Ray Tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book by  **Peter Shirley**, **Trevor David Black** and **Steve Hollasch**.

The code isn't an exact copy of theirs, I coded in my style with some of my ideas and understandings, but the ideas are basically the same.

The images in the `./img` directory were created at different steps as I was progressing through the program. They are alphabetically ordered from oldest to most recent.

Here's the final render:
