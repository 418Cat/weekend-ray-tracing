# Maths directory
I don't like to just follow guides blindly, what's really interesting is understanding the steps, be it logic or maths.
The files in here are me trying to solve the maths problems without looking at the book for solutions.

*Linear algebra is completely new to me, so there might be possible simplifications to be made.*
